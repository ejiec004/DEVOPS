📣🌟 I have delved into various SQL topics, and I can't wait to share my knowledge with you all. 🤩📚

🔹🔍 Throughout my learning journey, I have explored and grasped the concepts of:

1️⃣ Data Manipulation Language (DML) - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries for managing data with precision. 💪🗄️

2️⃣ Data Definition Language (DDL) - Creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, views, and indexes for efficient data organization. 🏗️📝

3️⃣ Data Query Language (DQL) - SELECT statements and querying databases to retrieve specific information and insights. 📊🔍

4️⃣ Data Control Language (DCL) - GRANT and REVOKE statements to manage user permissions and access control within the database. 🔐🔒

🔹📈 Furthermore, I've gained expertise in database normalization techniques, enabling efficient data storage and minimizing redundancy. 🔄📊

🔹🔄 Additionally, I have dived into the world of subqueries, which allow for advanced data retrieval by nesting queries within queries. 📊🔗

🔹🔢 Moreover, I have mastered window functions, empowering me to perform complex calculations and analysis over specified subsets of data. 🪟🧮

🔹🤝 With this comprehensive understanding of SQL, including **subqueries and window functions**, I am equipped to tackle data-related challenges and optimize database operations even further. 💼📈
